# ESJZone-backup
Recently ESJZone will remove some of their novel. Here is a simple way to backup those translated novel and at the same time learn about a popular python package called BeautifulSoup.

Prepare a folder called "ESJZone" in the same directory as this python file or jupyter notebook.

```
python3 ESJZone_backup.py -url https://www.esjzone.cc/detail/1557379934.html # The url of the novel content page.
                          -skip 100                                          # The first few lines that we want to skip because they are not ESJZone pages.
```
